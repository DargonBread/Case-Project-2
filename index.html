        <p>&#x2022; &nbsp; This is my personal portfolio, meant to show off what I have accomplished throughout my time as a student in the coding technology course at Pearl River Community College.</p>

        <p>&#x2022; &nbsp; This will start out bare at first with nothing to show, but as my skills grow and my projects become more frequent over time, they will be added to this website. The look and feel of this portfolio will change along the way, as my knowledge of not just HTML, but CSS and JavaScript increase over time.</p>
